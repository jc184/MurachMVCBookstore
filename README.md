# MurachMVCBookstore
This repository is my version of the MVC Bookstore application from the book Murach's ASP.NET Core MVC by Mary Delameter and Joel Murach.
It is an ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC project using the Repository Pattern and Unit of Work Pattern. Once the repo has been cloned the user should just 
run the 'Update-Database' command in the PM Console in Visual Studio. This is assuming that a version of SQL Server is also installed.
